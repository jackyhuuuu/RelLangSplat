# Overview
The model aims to deal with the relation query in the scene. Before using the model, you need to train your scene on LangSplat, which you can follow [LangSplat](https://github.com/minghanqin/LangSplat), the code to run LangSplat is also included in the repo.

Make sure your code have the following sturcture:
```RelLangSplat
<br>|---ckpts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
<br>|---lerf_ovs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---<scene_name>
<br>|---output
